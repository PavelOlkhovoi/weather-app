# Weather-Journal App Project

## Overview
This is my first asynchronous app for self-education. The app allows users to fetch weather data by zip code and combines it with users' messages about their weather feeling. 

## Usage
Just enter the `zip code` of some US cities and type your text with weather feeling.
